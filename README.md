Based on the attached this .... and Based on Etsy’s Seller Handbook update from August 22, 2025, help me write an optimized SEO etsy title:
Clearly state the item for sale, like “mug” or “dress”
Include the most important traits upfront, like your item’s color, material, and size
Streamline for clarity and scannability. Consider using less than 15 words when including the traits that make your item special.
Only include holidays, special occasions, or recipient types if they’re essential to what the item is, like “birthday candle” or “Halloween costume”
Move subjective words, like “perfect” or “beautiful,” to the description
Try not to repeat words
Don’t worry about adding info about price, shipping, or sales. Etsy helps take care of this by badging your items in Search.
 and 13 seo tags for this. All Tags are limited to 20 characters for each tag and separated by commas , verify the wordmark, trademark, and copyright status of this item
